# react-hook-useInfiniteScrolling
Small custom hook I am using for infinite scroll components, for detecting if user scrolled to the bottom.
You can use needToFetch to realise that you need to do something - if it true, it means that user scrolled down to the bootom of page, and setNeedToFetch to switch it.
